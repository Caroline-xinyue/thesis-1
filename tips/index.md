#### Start writing early in the process

Writing 80 pages doesn't take 2 weeks. 
Or if it does, then you're either a super-hero and the quality of what you wrote is probably poor.
Start to write *early*, ideally by P3 you should have written your "Related work" section, and parts of some sections.

#### Use LaTeX and not Word

We offer an [easy LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelftgeomatics/thesis_template) to help you start.
Since you've learned to program in Python, LaTeX should take you no more than 2 days to master.
These two days are worth it, your structure will most likely be better structured, will look better, and will contain less errors.

Basically everything you need to know---from installation to details---is there available in [this free book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

To compile LaTeX, you need a full installation of [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (OSX) or [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (cross-platform).


#### Use a reference manager for your references

If you use LaTeX, [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) is a great cross-platform application.

With Word, Endnote is the equivalent.
It's free for students on the Blackboard I believe.

#### Draw *vector* figures

IPE for drawing, or Illustrator (avoid raster figures, they are huge and not-readable)
