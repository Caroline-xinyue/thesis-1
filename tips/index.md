#### Start writing early in the process

Writing 80 pages doesn't take 2 weeks. 
Or if it does, then you're either a super-hero and the quality of what you wrote is probably poor.
Start to write *early*, ideally by P3 you should have written your "Related work" section, and parts of some sections.

Start early, but do so with a plan.
First you should plan what the structure of your thesis will be.
We think it is best to first draft a table of content and discuss it with your supervisors. 
Once they agree that the structure is logical, then you can start writing without fearing that you'll need to restructure the whole document at a later stage.

Also, writing often highlights weaknesses and missing experiments.
So start write early.

#### It's the thesis that counts

What you produce---the thesis---is the main deliverables that will be judged for your final mark.
How you worked (indepedently?), how you carried out the research project, and how complex is the topic, will, among others, also be taken into account.
But what can be best judged (ie objectively) by the committee at the end is the *thesis*.

This means that you even if you for instance have produced great code that runs faster and smoother than that of your colleague, she might get a higher mark if she produces a "better" thesis.

Keep this in mind, and allocate enough time for the writing up.

#### Use LaTeX (and not Word)

We offer a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelftgeomatics/thesis_template) to help you start.
Since you've learned to program in Python, LaTeX should take you no more than 2 days to master.
These two days are worth it, your structure will most likely be better structured, will look better, and will contain less errors.

Basically everything you need to know---from installation to details---is available in [this free book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

To compile LaTeX, you need a full installation of [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (OSX) or [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (cross-platform).

#### Use a reference manager for your references

*Every* paper you read should be added to your manager with all the details.
It takes 2min to do it after you've read the paper.
Also, it's a good idea to summarise the paper in your own words.
Sounds silly, but we can guarantee you that 6 months later when you are writing your thesis you'll think that this is the best thing you've ever done.

If you use LaTeX, [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) is a great cross-platform one.
If you use Word, [Endnote](http://endnote.com) is the equivalent (it's free for students on the Blackboard apparently).

#### What you learned in a course might not be best for a thesis

Piece of advise from [Peter McMahon](http://web.stanford.edu/~pmcmahon/ThesisWritingTips.pdf):

> The structure and style of a good thesis typically looks very different to what is taught in "professional communication" classes in many universities. This is unsurprising: in most cases, professional communication lecturers are neither scientists nor engineers, and have never written a scientific document, let alone a science or engineering thesis. No wonder their advice is ill-suited for science or engineering writing! Any grammar lessons that one obtains in professional communications classes are advantageous, but I recommend that you ignore everything else that they teach about report writing.

#### Read scientific papers and theses 

The best way to get to know how to write and structure a thesis is to read many of them.
We propose some [examples of good MSc Geomatics theses](/completedtheses/) in recent years.
Scientific articles are also a good way to get to know how to write "in a academic style".

#### Use *vector* figures/plots

Avoid raster figures, they are huge, do not scale well and do not look nice.
Besides the obvious Adobe Illustrator, we recommend [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (both free and cross-platform).

#### With the P5 thesis, submit a rebuttal/corrections document

Your committee will have to read your thesis twice: before P4 (the draft thesis) and before P5 (final version).
It's in your interest to tell them clearly what was changed between the two versions: they will appreciate not having to re-read parts that haven't changed, and will be able to focus on the parts you've improved.

This rebuttal and corrections document should be 1-2 pages maximum, submitted as as extra document (or in an email).
Include all the significant/important parts that you have modified or added.
Also, if you didn't process some comments from a member of the committee, write it clearly and state why.
