#### It's the thesis that counts

What you produce---the thesis---is the main deliverables that will be judged for your final mark.
How you worked (indepedently?), how you carried out the research project, and how complex is the topic, will, among others, also be taken into account.
But what can be best judged (ie objectively) by the committee at the end is the thesis.

This means that you even if you for instance have produced great code that runs faster and smoother than that of your colleague, she might get a higher mark if she produces a "better" thesis.

Keep this in mind, and allocate enough time for the writing up.


#### Start writing early in the process

Writing 80 pages doesn't take 2 weeks. 
Or if it does, then you're either a super-hero and the quality of what you wrote is probably poor.
Start to write *early*, ideally by P3 you should have written your "Related work" section, and parts of some sections.


#### Use LaTeX (and not Word)

We offer a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelftgeomatics/thesis_template) to help you start.
Since you've learned to program in Python, LaTeX should take you no more than 2 days to master.
These two days are worth it, your structure will most likely be better structured, will look better, and will contain less errors.

Basically everything you need to know---from installation to details---is available in [this free book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).

To compile LaTeX, you need a full installation of [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (OSX) or [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (cross-platform).


#### Use a reference manager for your references

*Every* paper you read should be added to your manager with all the details.
It takes 2min to do it after you've read the paper.
Also, it's a good idea to summarise the paper in your own words.
Sounds silly, but we can guarantee you that 6 months later when you are writing your thesis you'll think that this is the best thing you've ever done.

If you use LaTeX, [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) is a great cross-platform application.
With Word, [Endnote](http://endnote.com) is the equivalent (it's free for students on the Blackboard apparently).


#### Draw *vector* figures

Avoid raster figures, they are huge and do not scale well.

Besides the obvious Adobe Illustrator, we recommend [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org) (free and cross-platform) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
