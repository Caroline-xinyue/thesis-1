#### Why are there 2 separates courses? GEO2010 & GEO2020

[GEO2010](http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35530) is for the preparation work and up to the P2 (including it).
If you pass P2, you pass GEO2010 (and get the 15 ECTS).
There is no grade attached to it, it's either a pass or a fail.

[GEO2020](http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35531) is for the rest of the graduation trajectory; you get a grade a the end of P5 (and the remaining 30 ECTS).

#### How do I pick a topic?

Two options:

  1. you like one MSc Geomatics staff and like her/his area of research? Contact directly that person to discuss a topic.
  2. have a look at the [potential topics]({{ "/potentialtopics/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) offered and contact directly the person listed as daily supervisor and/or graduation professor.

#### How long should my thesis be?

*As short as possible*, but it needs to cover all the criteria in the Appendix 1 of the [Graduation Manual]({{ "/rules/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Writing concisely is difficult and time-consuming.
Actually, it takes more time than writing long pieces.
As Blaise Pascal wrote (free translation):

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.

But since you insist on having a page number, around 75 pages is probably what is expected (with a "normal" amount of figures and tables). 

This plot shows the average number of pages of MSc theses at the University of Minnesota in different fields.
Geomatics is not in the list, but the average is clearly under 100, and in many fields a bit above 50.

#### Can I pick as Daily Supervisor someone from another faculty?

Yes.

#### Is there a template for the final thesis?

Officially no.
But we provide a [LaTeX one]({{ "/templates/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to help you start.

#### Can I put figures I have found in papers/theses/websites?

Yes. As long as you make it crystal clear that this is *not* your own figure and that you put a clear reference in the caption.

Notice that if all your figures are taken from other sources, that gives the impression that you didn't develop your own solution.

#### Am I allowed to "reuse" the work of others? When does it become plagiarism?

Complex question to answer here.
First, read the [TU Delft position about fraud and plagiarism](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/en/students/legal-position/fraud-plagiarism/what-is-fraud/), and if in doubt speak to your daily supervisor and graduation professor.

There are [serious consequences](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/en/students/legal-position/fraud-plagiarism/consequences/) if you are caught.

#### Can my thesis be written in Dutch?

No. And your presentations must also be in English.
