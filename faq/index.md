### How to I pick a topic?

Two options:

  1. you like one MSc Geomatics staff and like her/his area of research? Contact directly that person to discuss a topic.
  2. have a look a the [potiental topics](/potentialtopics/) offered and contact directly the person listed as daily supervisor and/or graduation professor.


### How long should my thesis be?

As short as possible, but needs to cover everything that is asked in the criteria.

Writing consicely is difficult and takes time, actually more time than writing a lot.
As Blaise Pascal wrote (free translation):

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.

But since you insist on having a page number, around 75 pages (with a "normal" amount of figures and tables) is probably what is expected. 

This plot shows the average number of pages of MSc theses at the University of Minnesota in different fields.

There's not Geomatics, but the average is cleary way under 100, and in many fields a bit above 50.
