## P2 template

The template in the graduation manual is the one you should follow (see Appendix 2).
*Ignore* any template you get from the central BK system if different, they send these emails without realising that Geomatics doesn't have the same criteria.

The document for P2 is a research proposal that must contain all the elements listed in the template.
You are however free to write it with the word processor of your choice (including LaTeX), as long as all the sections are present (you are allowed to add sub-sections).
Also, this is a scientific proposal, so references are mandatory (even if there is no specific section in the template).

We expect a project plan to be around 10-15 pages.
It should show that you clearly know the problem you will aim at solving, and that you master the related work.
We expect you to present the methodology you will use to solve your scientific problem(s), and to present preliminary results.
<!-- You should however have a crystal-clear idea of what you will do, with what methodology, and the pitfalls that you will encounter. -->


## Template for the final thesis (P4 & P5)

Officially there is no template.
However, we have made a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelftgeomatics/thesis_template) containing all the parts that are required and is structured in such a way that most/all supervisors expect.
It looks like [this](https://github.com/tudelftgeomatics/thesis_template/raw/master/thesis.pdf).
*It is not an official template and it is not mandatory to use it.*

Notice that the TU Delft also has a [generic template for report](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/Files/medewerkersportal/mc/huisstijl/Downloads/latex_newreport.zip), but it's rather buggy and must be modified for an MSc thesis.

You are of course allowed to use Word (or others), if you want.

While you're allowed to structure your thesis you way you like it, good theses (ie the ones that got hight marks) roughly follow this structure:

##### 1. Introduction (~7 pages)

What is the scientific problem are aiming to solve? Why is it relevant in Geomatics? What are your research questions?

##### 2. Related work (~15 pages)

Overview of all the topics related to your main research question. 
You must provide some context for the reader, and when explaining what others have done, explain clearly how their work relates to yours.

##### 3. Methodology/Experimental design (~25 pages)

Describe the design of your experiments and/or present the algorithm/methodology you propose.

##### 4. Experiments, results and analysis (~20 pages)

Present your results, details of the experiments (including datasets used) and provide an analysis of them.

##### 5. Conclusion, discussion and future work (âˆ¼5 pages)

Summarise your main result and give a clear answer to the research question you defined in the Introduction.
Discuss what did not work too.
Give an overview of new research questions that arose during your research, or promising ideas you had but didn't have time to investigate.

#####  6.  Appendices
 
Any material that would break the flow of the thesis: details about datasets, UML diagrams, list of tools and configurations used, etc.
Code you wrote you should be all printed in your thesis.
Instead, put it somewhere publicly accessible (eg GitHub) and give a link to the reader.
