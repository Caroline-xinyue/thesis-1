## P2 template

The template in the graduation manual is the one you should follow (see Appendix 2).
*Ignore* any template you get from the central BK system if different, they send these emails without realising that Geomatics doesn't have the same criteria.

The document for P2 is a research proposal containing all the elements listed in the template.
You are however free to write it with the word processor of your choice (including LaTeX), as long as all the sections are present (you are allowed to add sub-sections).
Also, this is a scientific proposal, so references are mandatory.

We expect a project plan to be around 10-15 pages.
It should show that you clearly know the problem you will aim at solving, and that you master the related work.
We expect you to present the methodology you will use to solve your scientific problem(s), and to present preliminary results.
<!-- You should however have a crystal-clear idea of what you will do, with what methodology, and the pitfalls that you will encounter. -->


## Template for the final thesis (P4 & P5)

Officially there is no template.
However, we have made a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelft3d/MScGeomaticsThesisTemplate) that containing all the parts that are required and is structured in such a way that most/all supervisors expect.
It looks like [this](https://github.com/tudelft3d/MScGeomaticsThesisTemplate/raw/master/thesis.pdf).
*It is not an official template and it is not mandatory to use it.*

While you're allowed to structure your thesis you way you like it, good theses (ie the ones that got hight marks) roughly follow this structure:

  1. __Introduction__ ∼5 pages. Explain the purpose of the thesis. 
  2. __Related Work__ ∼15 pages. Overview of all topics related to your main topic. You must provide some context for the reader, and when explaining what others have done, explain how their work relates to yours.
  3. __Experimental Design__ 20-30 pages. Explain the specific problems you set out to solve, and describe the design of your experiments.
  4. __Results and Analysis__ – 20-30 pages. Present your results, and provide analysis of them.
  5. __Conclusion, discussion and future work__ – ∼5 pages. Summarize what you did, what worked and what didn’t. Discuss potential future work that may fill gaps in your work, or approaches that seem promising to overcome problems you encountered but that you weren’t able to tackle.
  6.  Appendices – Include any material that would break the flow of the main body of your thesis in appendices. For example, appendices often include presentation of non-essential data; long proofs; elaborations of ideas for future work; code listings or other “methods” information (circuit designs and suchlike), and other documentation such as user guides.
