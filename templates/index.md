## P2 template

The template in the graduation manual is the one you should follow.
*Ignore* any template you get from the central BK system if different, they send these emails without realising that Geomatics doesn't have the same criteria.

P2 is a research proposal that should contain all the elements listed in the template.
You are however free to write it with the word processor of your choice (including LaTeX), as long as all the sections are present.

We expect a project plan to be around 10-15 pages.
It should show that you clearly know the problem you will aim at solving, and that you know the related work.
You may or may not have started your research, so if you have no results to show it is fine.
You should however have a crystal-clear idea of what you will do, with what methodology, and the pitfalls that you will encounter.


## Template for the final thesis (P4 & P5)

Officially there is no template.

The TU Delft offers one for report, but it is buggy and in my opinion not very pretty.

[Unofficial LaTeX template](https://github.com/tudelft3d/MScGeomaticsThesisTemplate)

Looks like [this](https://github.com/tudelft3d/MScGeomaticsThesisTemplate/raw/master/thesis.pdf)

The thesis report documents the results of the Masterâ€™s Thesis Project (Use: "Guidelines for writing a report"). It contains an account of the work, the followed procedure, intermediate milestones and the decisions taken.

The thesis report must be written in English.

The thesis report has a title page which contains the title of the thesis, the date of the thesis defense, the name and student number, the chosen specialisation, the master programme, the faculty EEMCS, and TU Delft.

The thesis report contains a preface that explains the topic of the thesis, the context (institute or company), the main findings in a few lines and the names of the members of the thesis committee. The preface may end with a few acknowledgements, and completed with name and date.

The thesis report contains an introduction chapter that introduces the main research themes and gives an overview of the report.

The thesis report contains a chapter with prior art that describes previous work and scientific publications relevant for the topic. This chapter reformulates the research questions in a form that complies with the state of the art in the field.

The thesis report contains several chapters that describe the performed work.

The thesis report concludes with a concluding chapter with a discussion of the results, and 
recommendations and suggestions for future research.
