#### Urban Heat Island Effect

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) has grown into one of the most prominent issues of the climate change related challenges society faces. The term Urban Heat Island refers to the temperature difference between an urban area and it's natural or rural surroundings. This heating up of cities has effects on human health, wellbeeing but also on the energy use and biodiversity. How much acity heats up is heavily related how we construct our city, more impervious area and less green ares for example are often related to higher temperatures. Most of the recent research used either remot sensing or outdoor temperature measurements to assess the sizeand effects of the UHI. This summer 3.000 thermometers were distributed in houses and streets in Rotterdam. Which will allow to put the UHI research on a new level. Students will be working in close relation to the research team.


The objective of this assignment is to investigate the relation between the built environment and the urban heat island effect in the city of Rotterdam ([www.hotterdam.eu](www.hotterdam.eu)). The challenge lies in dealing with data from a variety of sources, remote sensing, municipality GIS as well as sensors and develop meaningful ways to inform decision makers in the field of urban planning and design but also health and climate adaptations.
Thesis topics can deal with different aspects of this challenge like:

  - data management, handling and modelling: How to model and visualise the temperature for the whole city based on data from 3.000 points.
  - spatial analyses and spatial statistics: Investigating the relation of urban form and the temperature in open spaces as well as houses?
  - Geodesign: Development of a 3D model that allows to assess different urban design proposals according to their influence on the urban heat island.

#### Mobility of People

There are loads of datasets with tracks of people collected by GPS collected by different groups, for example pedestrians in city centres or even more interesting all mobility of people in one week. This research intends to investigate rules for mobility per neighbourhood, i.e. defining a relation between spatial configuration of programme and network, position in the city, position in the region and the actual movement pattern of people (mode, destination). The research should also investigate which other spatial data sets will be needed and connect those to the available mobility data.

#### Optimal Cycling Infrastructure

Given the European priorities in the areas of energy and transport, there is a trend for increasing the role
of walking and cycling in urban transportation in order to reduce urban road congestion and use of fossil
fuels. Walking and Cycling are referred to as active modes in transportation engineering, as they necessitate active physical and cognitive involvement of travellers. Convenient paths for cycling can be
identified as those that are convenient both in term of physical ease of cycling and cognitive ease of way finding; to these two we can also add a social dimension: safety and desirable social interactions. It is
workable to address the three aspects largely by studying (3D) maps and models of built environment. Any model principally reduces the complexity of real world; therefore, there are always aspects that
cannot be addressed in models; however, models can be used as bases for explanatory theories. When
using a theory, we can predict what would happen if an intervention takes place. With the ever- decreasing public budgets of municipal and regional authorities, it is of outmost importance to be able to
plan knowingly for any intervention. Theories that associate the human behaviour to spatial structure and configuration (such as –but not limited to- Space Syntax) can play an important role in studying the so-
called ‘what-if scenarios’.

Convenient paths for cycling can be identified as those that are convenient both in term of physical ease
of cycling and cognitive ease of way finding; to these two we can also add a social dimension: e.g. safety
and desirable social interactions. It is workable to address the three aspects largely by studying (3D)
maps and models of built environment. Theories that associate the human behaviour to spatial structure
and configuration (such as –but not limited to- Space Syntax) can play an important role in analysing
different scenarios.
Path finding and network studies are central to this research. The ultimate goal is to come up with a
methodology for finding optimal cycling paths, mapping cycling accessibility and predicating usage of
cycling network utilising spatial network models and graph algorithms.
