#### 3D Indoor space analysis for wayfinding  

In the absence of analytic tools, buildings are usually designed and only analysed in case there are spatial problems; however, with the ever-increasing computation power and the emergence of new computational methods, it is practical to bring analysis to the beginning of design processes and therefore contribute to achieving better spatial qualities. The importance of such analyses is more apparent in public buildings such as transportation hubs, hospitals but in fact can be researched in almost every building. Whether dealing with existing or designed buildings, 3D spatial analyses help in simulating usage of spaces and checking spatial qualities against standards, for instance regarding ease of way finding e.g. for visitors and also in case of emergency evacuations. 

The spatial configuration of indoor space directly affects many functional aspects of building such as ease of way finding, sense of privacy and community and likelihood of social interactions; all of which can be studied by means of Computational Graph Theory on spatial network models. An indoor spatial network model can be composed of elements such as a set of discrete rooms or convex units of space; it can also be modelled as a rather continuous set of voxels. Central to spatial analysis are path finding algorithms and visibility analysis algorithms that can be used to rank spaces, cluster spaces or predict their usage in terms of likely frequencies of visit or passage.  This research will concentrate on analysis of indoor spaces to facilitate indoor orientation and wayfinding in unknown environments. On the basis of 3D geometry of rooms and corridors, visibility indicators will be defined that will facilitate guidance of visitors.

#### Urban Heat Island Effect

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) has grown into one of the most prominent issues of the climate change related challenges society faces. The term Urban Heat Island refers to the temperature difference between an urban area and it's natural or rural surroundings. This heating up of cities has effects on human health, wellbeeing but also on the energy use and biodiversity. How much acity heats up is heavily related how we construct our city, more impervious area and less green ares for example are often related to higher temperatures. Most of the recent research used either remot sensing or outdoor temperature measurements to assess the sizeand effects of the UHI. This summer 3.000 thermometers were distributed in houses and streets in Rotterdam. Which will allow to put the UHI research on a new level. Students will be working in close relation to the research team.


The objective of this assignment is to investigate the relation between the built environment and the urban heat island effect in the city of Rotterdam ([www.hotterdam.eu](www.hotterdam.eu)). The challenge lies in dealing with data from a variety of sources, remote sensing, municipality GIS as well as sensors and develop meaningful ways to inform decision makers in the field of urban planning and design but also health and climate adaptations.
Thesis topics can deal with different aspects of this challenge like:

  - data management, handling and modelling: How to model and visualise the temperature for the whole city based on data from 3.000 points.
  - spatial analyses and spatial statistics: Investigating the relation of urban form and the temperature in open spaces as well as houses?
  - Geodesign: Development of a 3D model that allows to assess different urban design proposals according to their influence on the urban heat island.

#### Campus Project

Delft is developing a campus project. A lot of knowledge is available about the Real Estate, but hardly any accurate data on the 'use' . How is the campus used, how are facilities used? Can we use WiFi tracking as a method to gain insight in actual use ,movement around the campus and effectively make this an instrument to determine changes in the Real Estate, Public Space and Programme of the campus? The research will concentrate on approaches for efficient collection, storage and analysis of
information. This proposal is linked to the Strategic Campus Project.

#### Mobility of People

There are loads of datasets with tracks of people collected by GPS collected by different groups, for example pedestrians in city centres or even more interesting all mobility of people in one week. This research intends to investigate rules for mobility per neighbourhood, i.e. defining a relation between spatial configuration of programme and network, position in the city, position in the region and the actual movement pattern of people (mode, destination). The research should also investigate which other spatial data sets will be needed and connect those to the available mobility data.

#### Optimal Cycling Infrastructure

Given the European priorities in the areas of energy and transport, there is a trend for increasing the role
of walking and cycling in urban transportation in order to reduce urban road congestion and use of fossil
fuels. Walking and Cycling are referred to as active modes in transportation engineering, as they necessitate active physical and cognitive involvement of travellers. Convenient paths for cycling can be
identified as those that are convenient both in term of physical ease of cycling and cognitive ease of way finding; to these two we can also add a social dimension: safety and desirable social interactions. It is
workable to address the three aspects largely by studying (3D) maps and models of built environment. Any model principally reduces the complexity of real world; therefore, there are always aspects that
cannot be addressed in models; however, models can be used as bases for explanatory theories. When
using a theory, we can predict what would happen if an intervention takes place. With the ever- decreasing public budgets of municipal and regional authorities, it is of outmost importance to be able to
plan knowingly for any intervention. Theories that associate the human behaviour to spatial structure and configuration (such as –but not limited to- Space Syntax) can play an important role in studying the so-
called ‘what-if scenarios’.

and configuration (such as –but not limited to- Space Syntax) can play an important role in analysing
different scenarios.
Path finding and network studies are central to this research. The ultimate goal is to come up with a
methodology for finding optimal cycling paths, mapping cycling accessibility and predicating usage of
cycling network utilising spatial network models and graph algorithms.

#### Solar Energy Potential Calculation  

Making a decision for placing solar panels in large scale will depend on an estimate of their economic utility in terms of how much they would pay off for their initial costs of purchase and installation. The efficiency of solar panels is increasingly becoming better but still it would make most sense to place them where the highest yield can be achieved. Buildings often shade each other and thus affect the amount of ‘annual’ effective solar irradiance (solar energy per unit area) available on each other. Most simulataion software application packages require many inputs merely to calculate solar irradiance for a given moment in time. However, for making such decisions one would need to look at average annual potentials, preferably with the least essential amount of input data required. 


Solar potential of buildings in terms of Solar Irradiance for installing solar panels has can be investigated on 3D models such as LOD1 and LOD2 3D city models that are becoming commonly available. These models can be used for running quick simulations. However the tools currently used often require many inputs to operate and only run on sophisticated platforms and thus are not designer friendly. The main challenge of this research will be to investigate which are the minimum number of criteria that are needed to obtain acceptable simulations of solar potential of buildings. A Solar Irradiance ‘estimation’ methodology should be developed and implemented as a proof of concept user-friendly simulation engine, which can be used as a kernel for a PSS.
