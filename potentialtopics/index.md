Below you can find some *potential* topics from the different staff members involved in the MSc Geomatics programme; they are divided by research groups.

These are only indications of a potential topic, and will have to be refined/extended/specified for the P2 milestone.
Other topics are possible, and we encourage you to propose your own topics: speak directly to a supervisor of your choice.

The chosen topic must be *related to Geomatics*, ie even if you find one area of civil engineering or urbanism very interesting, the way that topic is approached must be inline with the overall learning objectives of the MSc Geomatics programme.
