Below you can find some *potential* topics from the different staff members involved in the MSc Geomatics programme; they are divided by research groups.

These are only indications of a potential topic, and will have to be refined/extended/specified for the P2 milestone.
Other topics are possible, and we encourage you to propose your own topics: speak directly to a supervisor of your choice.

The chosen topic must be *related to Geomatics*, ie even if you find one area of urbanism very interesting, the way that topic is approached must be inline with the overall learning objectives of the MSc Geomatics programme.
