[Rijkswaterstaat](http://www.rws.nl/) Rijkswaterstaat is part of the Dutch
Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment and responsible for the design,
construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities
in the Netherlands. This includes:

  -   the main road network
  -   the main waterway network
  -   the main watersystems

Below you find one research topic that may be done as in internship at RWS:

#### Privacy issues regard AIS ships logs

All vessels in the Netherlands with a length greater than 20 meters 
are obliged to carry an AIS transponder that
transmits their position. Vessels know, with the use of AIS, if there are other
vessels within a 5km range. RWS collects al this data for the purpose of traffic
management. There are many other possible applications for this data
but because of privacy issues the the ships locations cannot be published as
they are and need to be anononymized or pseudonymized. However this 
reduces the usability of the data. RWS is interested in knowing how the data can
be used for as many use cases as possible (provided by RWS) without compromising
the privacy concerns of the ships owners.

In collaboration with RWS you can explore the possibilities for a research
topic. Depending on your interest the focus of your research may be on
anonymization or legal obligations regarding privacy.
