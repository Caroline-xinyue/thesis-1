[Rijkswaterstaat](http://www.rws.nl/) Rijkswaterstaat is part of the Dutch
Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment and responsible for the design,
construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities
in the Netherlands. This includes:

  -   the main road network
  -   the main waterway network
  -   the main watersystems

Below you find one research topic that may be done as in internship at RWS:

#### Privacy issues with AIS ships logs

All vessels in the Netherlands with a length greater than 20 meters 
are obliged to carry an AIS transponder that
transmits their position. Vessels know, with the use of AIS, if there are other
vessels within a 5km range. RWS collects all this data for the purpose of traffic
management, resulting in a database of all ships movements in the Netherlands.
Besides traffic management there are many possible applications for this
data. Because of privacy regulations (if you know where the ship is, you know
where the owner is) the data needs to be anononymized or pseudonymized before it
can be used. However this reduces
the usability of the data.  RWS is interested in knowing how the data can be
used for as many use cases as possible (provided by RWS) without compromising
the privacy concerns of the ships owners.

In collaboration with RWS you can explore the possibilities for a research
topic. Depending on your interest the focus of your research may be on
anonymization or legal obligations regarding privacy.
