#### Contribute to the Platform Making Sense for Society

The Platform Making Sens for Society is a Living Lab for gaining knowledge
about the use of sensors in the public space. It is a  platform where
companies, knowledge institutes and the government work together to get better
knowledge of the possibilities that sensors give for our society. 

Within the platform experiments are done.  This topic gives you the opportunity
to bring your knowledge from the synthesis project to society and expand your
own knowledge.

#### Gettint the 3rd dimension of gas pipes from AHN 

Note: This is not really a Geonovum topic but an [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/en) topic.

Alliander is maintaining a big part of the gas network in the Netherlands. The 2D location of the network is well known but elevation is not known and this elevation is needed for gas-flow calculations. By combining the 2D map with the 3D point cloud map of the Netherlands a fully 3D map of the gas network could be created.
