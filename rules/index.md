## The different milestones of the graduation process 

  1. __P1:__ 2 page overview + short presentation. You should know what you will do, but you haven't done all the work yet 
  1. __P2:__ expanded P1 in research proposal (10-15 pages) and extended presentation. Background and methodology should be clear at this stage.
  1. __P3:__ mid-term progress (only presentation, no document to submit). A good idea to have written some parts of the thesis; or it's a good idea to start thinking about it.
  1. __P4:__ full draft thesis + full presentation
  1. __P5:__ final thesis + final presentation
