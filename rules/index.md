  - [Forms to register for P2/P4](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/en/students/faculty-specific/architecture/forms/) (there is no forms for P5, your mentor does that for you after a successful P4).

Even if it takes you 2 years to complete, the rules that applied when you started are the rules that apply during your whole graduation process.


## The different milestones of the graduation process 

  | Milestone | Deliverable(s) | Remarks |
  |:----------|:---------------|:--------|
  | P1        | draft project plan + 5min presentation | You should know what you will do, but you haven't done the work yet  |
  | P2        | final graduation plan (~12 pages) + 15min pres | Background and methodology should be clear at this stage. And you should have preliminary results. |
  | P3        | mid-term progress (only presentation, no document to submit) | A good idea to have written some parts of the thesis; or it's a very good idea to start thinking about it  |
  | P4        | complete draft thesis + 30min presentation |  |
  | P5        | final thesis + 30min presentation |  |
