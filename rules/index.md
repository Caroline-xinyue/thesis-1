  | Milestone | Deliverable(s) | Remarks |

  | P2        | final graduation plan (~12 pages) + 15min pres | Background and methodology should be clear at this stage. And you should have preliminary results. |
  | P3        | mid-term progress (only presentation, no document to submit) | A good idea to have written some parts of the thesis; or it's a very good idea to start thinking about it  |
