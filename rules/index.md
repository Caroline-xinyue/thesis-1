## The official material

  
  - [Official Graduation Manual 2016-2017](GraduationManualGeomatics2016-2017F161216.pdf)
  - [Official Graduation Manual 2015-2016](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/Files/studentenportal/os/BKspecifiek/Graduation_Manual_Geomatics_2015-2016.pdf)
  - [Official Graduation Manual 2014-2015]({{ "/pdfs/Graduation Manual Geomatics 2014-2015.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) 
  - [Forms to register for P2/P4](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/en/students/faculty-specific/architecture/forms/) (there is no forms for P5, your mentor does that for you after a successful P4).

Notice that you have to follow the rules of the year you started your graducation work.
Even if it takes you 2 years to complete, the rules that applied when you started are the rules that apply during your whole graduation process.


## The different milestones of the graduation process 

  | Milestone | Deliverable(s) | Remarks |
  |:----------|:---------------|:--------|
  | P1        | draft project plan + 5min presentation | You should know what you will do, but you haven't done the work yet  |
  | P2        | final graduation plan (~12 pages) + 15min pres | Background and methodology should be clear at this stage. And you should have preliminary results. |
  | P3        | mid-term progress (only presentation, no document to submit) | A good idea to have written some parts of the thesis; or it's a very good idea to start thinking about it  |
  | P4        | complete draft thesis + 30min presentation |  |
  | P5        | final thesis + 30min presentation |  |

## The rubic for marking the final thesis

The evaluation criteria that will be used by the committee to mark the final thesis, also called a rubric, are available in the Appendix 1 of the Graduation Manual.

However, for P5, we now have a new and (much) improved version that makes it better and clearer. 
From now one, this is what will be used to mark all graduation theses in Geomatics.
You can download it:

  - [XLSX](Rubric_Geomatics_2017-04-12.xlsx)
  - [PDF (A4)](Rubric_Geomatics_A4.pdf)
  - [PDF (A3)](Rubric_Geomatics_A3.pdf)
