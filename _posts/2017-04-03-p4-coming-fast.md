I got a few questions from some of you concerning P4, so here are some answers:

  - the deadline to apply is 2017-04-13
  - your P4 will held during that period: 2017-05-11 â€“> 2017-05-24
  - you don't choose the exact date, although you can propose it. The central administration does.
  - the *full draft* of your thesis needs to be handed in one week before your P4, which means that it could be on 2017-05-04, one month from today. Full draft means that all main results have been obtained and described.
  - if you can't make it, then the following period for P4 will be at the end of September 2017.
  - P4 is a go/nogo, thus what you submit is assessed.
