The P1 session is scheduled:

_When_: Monday 14 November 2016, 9:00--12:00

_Where_: BK Berlagezaal 1

Each presentation is 10min: 5min presentation + 5min questions. 
As I said, this is strict so that ~15 of you fit in the 3h.

I am hoping that all staff of Geomatics will attend. Your main supervisor should be present.

I'll make a list and bundle students with same supervisors together. 
If you have constraints, let me know.
