I find it very thoughful that many of you are sending me their P2 proposal, but this is not necessary!

What you have to do for each P is in the [graduation manual](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/Files/studentenportal/os/BKspecifiek/Graduation_Manual_Geomatics_2015-2016.pdf), in this case on p.9:

> Hand in the Graduation Plan to the Mentors and and send Graduation Plan to the Secretariat of the Board of Examiners at least one week before P2.
