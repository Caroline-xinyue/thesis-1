The next introduction session, for those starting the graduation process this semester, is:

_When_: Friday 17 February 2017, 9:30--11:00

_Where_: BK BG.West.290


I'll give an overview of the graduation process, explain how to find a topic and a supervisor, what the milestones are, how to formulate research questions, and how to get a high final mark (!).

Cheers,
Hugo
