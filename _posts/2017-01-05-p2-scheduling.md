The P2s have been scheduled by the central administration and you can see your time/date by looking at [mytimetable.tudelft.nl](https://mytimetable.tudelft.nl). You need to either add yourself (yes, this is correct) with the `Add timetable` button on the top-right. Alternatively, you can add a course entitled `BK-P2 Ledoux` (where obviously you replace my name by yours).

If the time/date you were allocated to doesn't work for your supervisors, then you should contact the scheduling people, not me (since I have no control over this system).

If you were not scheduled and you can't see your name by the end of this week, drop me an email please.
