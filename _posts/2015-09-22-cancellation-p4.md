Some of you have registered for the P4 a few weeks ago, but finally the work done wasn't good enough to go to the P4? 
That's bound to happen, no problem.

What you have to do if this is the case:

  1. Inform as soon as possible your mentors, the co-reader and the chair person.
  2. Send an email to `afstuderen-bk@tudelft.nl` to inform the administration so that the room will not be blocked for nothing.
  3. Work hard and update your draft thesis.
  4. Don't forget to register for the next P4 period (in ~2 months).
