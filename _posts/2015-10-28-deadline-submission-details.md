I have received only [5 confirmations of topics]({{ "/inprogress/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) so far, and the P1 is approaching very fast.

I'm afraid I have to put a deadline: Thursday Nov 5th at 8:00.

Then I'll make the exact schedule with the staff and will publish it on Friday morning.

As a reminder, you just need to send me an email (`<h.ledoux@tudelft.nl>`) with the following:

  1. (tentative) title
  2. one-line research objective 
  3. 1st mentor
  4. 2nd mentor
  5. if applicable, which company is involved?
