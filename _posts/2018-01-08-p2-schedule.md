Many of you sent emails concerning the P2 schedule, so I guess it didn't go automatically to your own calendar (like previous year, "The System" is not perfect...).

The solution: go check in the official timetable of TU Delft as follows

  1. [https://mytimetable.tudelft.nl](https://mytimetable.tudelft.nl/)
  2. click add timetable
  3. select "Course" (and oddly *not* "Student")
  4. search for your own name 

Voil√†.  
If not there, then contact immediately the BK admin, it should be there.
