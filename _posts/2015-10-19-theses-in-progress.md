Some (only two of you actually) have confirmed their topic and mentors so far. 
As I receive the confirmations, I'll add them to a [new section about the overview of theses]({{ "/inprogress/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). 
So don't forgot to send yours as soon as possible.

The research objective you send doesn't need to be the final one. 
The P1 session is there to refine/modify it, and to get ideas from your mentors and your peers to improve your research.
For P1, you should have a clear idea of what you want to do, and some ideas about how you will solve your research problems, but it's normal if you don't have all the parts of the puzzle.
