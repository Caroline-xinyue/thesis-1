The introduction session is 

_When_: Friday 23 September 2016, 9:00--11:30

_Where_: BK Think Room

I'll give an overview of the graduation process, explain how to find a topic and a supervisor, what the milestones are, how to formulate research questions, and how to get a high final mark (!).

And different staff of the Geomatics program will come and present their topics.

To prepare, you can have a look at the [list of potential topics]({{ "/potentialtopics/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), which is being updated by the staff these days.
