I had a few questions concerning P2 registration. 
In short: if you presented on Monday (P1) then you have nothing to do, you'll be registered for the P2.
A date will be chosen by your supervisors.

If you haven't all the ECTS required, then the central administration will let you know. 
They check the ECTS, not me or your supervisors.
