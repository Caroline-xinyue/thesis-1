You might already have received an email, or will tomorrow, from the Exam Commission stating that you need to submit a draft Reflection at P3.

Ignore this email.

Only at P4 a draft reflection is asked for Geomatics, nothing has to be submitted at P3. Just a presentation (15min) with 15min for questions.
