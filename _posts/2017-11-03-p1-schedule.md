[The P1 schedule is now available](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hkyrcxwn8jwlr7y/p1-schedule.pdf?dl=0).

The next P1 sessions are scheduled over 2 days, you have to attend all of them, not only your own presentation:

  - __P1 (day1)__, 13 Nov 2017, 09:00 - 12:00, BK room R

  - __P1 (day2)__, 14 Nov 2017, 09:00 - 11:00, 3mE room K


Each presentation is 10min: 5min presentation + 5min questions. 
This is strict so that all of you fit in the timeslot.
Your main supervisor should be present, they were made aware of the schedule.
