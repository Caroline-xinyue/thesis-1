Reminder, the LaTeX course is this Friday (1 December 2018):

  - __GEO2020 LaTeX course__, 1 Dec 2017, 09:00 - 12:00, BK room Q

We will use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), but if you want to install LaTeX locally (I do that, online LaTeX is fine but not great in my opinion) then install either of these before the course (big download):

  - [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (macOS). 
  - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) 
  - [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (cross-platform)
