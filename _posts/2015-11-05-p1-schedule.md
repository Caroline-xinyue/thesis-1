The schedule for the P1 is as follows. 
Each session is 20min:

  1. a 10min-presentation where you present the problem you'll solve, why you are working on this (its links to Geomatics), how you plan to solve the problem (your research objectives), and if possible related work (what has been done on the topic by others).
  2. questions and comments from the staff present and your fellow students.

*You are expected to be present at all presentations, not only yours.*
The aim of the P1 is to help each others.
Your 1st mentor should be present, remind her/him.
Your 2nd mentor can of course come, but it's not mandatory (although she/he can replace the 1st).

All presentations are in room 01.West.290.
