To help you with writing your thesis, I have organised a small writing course.
Dirk Dubbeling, a staff at BK who has a lot of experience with editing books/monographs/magazine/etc, is the one who will give the course. 

When: Thursday 31st March 2016, 10:00-11:30

Where: Think Room (BK City)

Besides the course, I'd like to point out that on the website there are many things that can help you:

  1. [structure of a MSc thesis](http://tudelftgeomatics.github.io/thesis/templates/)
  1. [this document taylored from GIS/geomatics authors](http://tudelftgeomatics.github.io/thesis/tips/#read-this-document-about-producing-research-articles)
  1. [examples of good MSc geomatics theses](http://tudelftgeomatics.github.io/thesis/exampletheses/), which you should use as inspiration for the structure of your own thesis.
