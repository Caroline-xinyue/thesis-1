Reminder: the deadline to send me ([by email](mailto:h.ledoux@tudelft.nl)) your topic and 2 supervisors is __November 1 at 16:00__. I have so far received zero confirmations. 

Also, you are all expected to attend *all* P1 presentations, and not only your own. 
As soon as I have all confirmations, I'll draft a timetable and publish it. That should be after November 1 thus.

Also also, notice that some new topics have been added to the lists by the different groups, so it's perhaps worth doing another check.
