The next introduction session is 

_When_: Friday 9 September 2016, 9:00--12:00

_Where_: BK room U

I'll give an overview of the graduation process, explain how to find a
topic and a supervisor, what the milestones are, and how to get a high
final mark (!).

And different staff of the Geomatics program will come and present their topics.
We maintain a [list of potential topics]({{ "/potentialtopics/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
